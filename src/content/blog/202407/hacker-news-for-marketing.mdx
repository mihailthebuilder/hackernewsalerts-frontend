title: "Why you should consider using Hacker News for marketing"
description: "Hacker News is a great place to spread the word about your product, service, or blog. Just make sure that whatever you share is authentic."

If you want to raise awareness about your product/service/blog, you should try talking about it on [Hacker News](https://news.ycombinator.com/).

Want proof? Here are some stats for a blog I started last month\*:

![learningquant web analytics dashboard](./learningquant-stats.webp)

I generated **2.3k unique visits** from 2 posts I wrote and then shared on the website.

The average reader has a lot of buying capacity, too. You'll routinely see US-based software engineers sharing how they earn +$500k per year:

![HN user stating they earn 600k](./hn-user-salary.webp)

What kind of content does well? Sounds obvious, but it's anything that the personas I mentioned would like to talk about.

You're probably assuming only "tech-y stuff" will work? Wrong! There are plenty of conversations that went viral around topics way outside the community's primary focus. Here are some examples I spotted, just from today's feed:

![why Italy dislikes cilantro post](./italy-cilantro-hn-post.webp)
![lawyers paid well post](./lawyers-pay-hn-post.webp)
![women with no children post](./women-no-children-hn-post.webp)

While the content can be quite diverse, it must pass a certain bar around quality and authenticity. [This post](https://brooker.co.za/misc-blog/2024/01/23/skis.html) demonstrates my point - it's a hobbyist skier's personal take on whether skis get blunt. It's got [130 comments on Hacker News](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=40902740) in 9 hours, which probably will result in 10-20k visits to the blog.

So in case you were wondering, ChatGPT hacks won't work :)
